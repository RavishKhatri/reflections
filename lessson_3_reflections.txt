When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so that it doesnt automatically update your working branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used to clone another repository to your own github account so that you can make changes accordingly.
Clone is used for cloning the remote repo in your local machine.
Branch is used for making branches on your repo to add a feature


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To help in merging the remote at a later stage and you can also work on your local without connected to remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Maybe another vcs. Without VCS its harder to collaborate on large projects.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When a important feature,bug fix has to be added or you want to experiment on the project , then its good to make a branch. Otherwise for small changes , doing your work on master is good enough
